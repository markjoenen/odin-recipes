When the pasta is cooked turn the heat back on the pancetta (to medium high), add the drained pasta toss together to combine well for about 20-30 seconds, then remove the pan from the heat add the egg mixture, constantly tossing together add a tablespoon or two of pasta water to make sure it is very creamy and continue to toss until well blended.
